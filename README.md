# Data Job Dashboard

## Dashboard Display - Main

Dashboard created for job seekers, transitioners, and swappers to learn about the data job market. Using a dataset from 2024 job postings, it provides a single interface displaying the count, median salaries, job posting trends, and information about job titles compared to each other.

When examining specific titles, users may drill into a job-specific interface and expandings on postings, such as the job employment type, where they're posted most on job websites, and a visual map reference on where jobs are posted.
